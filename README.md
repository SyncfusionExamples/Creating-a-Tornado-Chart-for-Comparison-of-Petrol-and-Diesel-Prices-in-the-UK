# Creating-a-Tornado-Chart-for-Comparison-of-Petrol-and-Diesel-Prices-in-the-UK
In this section, we will compare the annual prices of ULSP (Ultra-low sulfur petrol) and ULSD (Ultra-low sulfur diesel) in the United Kingdom using a tornado chart. We'll be utilizing the power of the [.NET MAUI Syncfusion Cartesian Chart](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/getting-started). This chart will allow us to identify and compare the prices of petrol and diesel.

The tornado bar graph is an excellent tool for visualizing data in a way that allows for easy comparisons between different categories. In our case, we'll be visualizing a two-side bar graph, which is a visually striking way to showcase and compare prices of petrol and diesel in the UK

To render tornado chart, initialize the [SfCartesianChart](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfCartesianChart.html?tabs=tabid-1) and switch the chart X and Y axes by using the *IsTransposed* property as true.
